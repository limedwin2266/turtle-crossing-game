**Turtle Crossing Game**
This is a Python-based Turtle Crossing Game built using the turtle graphics library. 
The game involves controlling a turtle to cross a road filled with randomly generated cars. 
The goal is to reach the top of the screen without colliding with any cars while increasing the level as you successfully cross the road.

**Game Features**
- Turtle Movement: Use the Up Arrow key to move the turtle forward.
- Random Cars: Cars appear at random intervals and move across the screen.
- Leveling Up: Each time the player reaches the finish line, the game increases in difficulty by speeding up the cars.
- Collision Detection: If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends, and a "GAME OVER" message is displayed.
- Scoreboard: Displays the current level, which increases as the player successfully crosses the road.

**How to Play**
1. Start the game: Run the Python script.
2. Move the turtle: Press the Up Arrow key to move the turtle upwards across the screen.
3. Avoid the cars: Don't let the turtle collide with any cars that appear on the screen.
4. Reach the finish line: Cross the finish line at the top of the screen to increase the level and make the game more challenging.
5. Game Over: The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.
